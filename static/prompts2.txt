A penny for your thoughts
Actions speak louder than words
All's fair in love and war
Apple of my eye
As easy as pie
Beggars can't be choosers
Better late than never
Birds of a feather flock together
Bite the bullet
Blood is thicker than water
Break a leg
Burn the midnight oil
Cat got your tongue
Clean as a whistle
Cool as a cucumber
Curiosity killed the cat
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't cry over spilled milk
Don't judge a book by its cover
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't rock the boat
Early bird catches the worm
Easy come, easy go
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fit as a fiddle
Fortune favors the bold
Great minds think alike
Haste makes waste
He's a chip off the old block
Hit the nail on the head
Home sweet home
Honesty is the best policy
Ignorance is bliss
It's a piece of cake
It's raining cats and dogs
Kill two birds with one stone
Let sleeping dogs lie
Like father, like son
Love is blind
Money doesn't grow on trees
Necessity is the mother of invention
No pain, no gain
Once bitten, twice shy
Out of sight, out of mind
Penny wise, pound foolish
Practice makes perfect
Put your best foot forward
Rome wasn't built in a day
Slow and steady wins the race
Speak of the devil
The early bird gets the worm
The grass is always greener on the other side
The squeaky wheel gets the grease
There's no place like home
Third time's a charm
Time is money
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Two heads are better than one
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink
You can't judge a book by its cover
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You reap what you sow
A watched pot never boils
Actions speak louder than words
All good things must come to an end
All is fair in love and war
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Every cloud has a silver lining
Fortune favors the bold
Hindsight is 20/20
Ignorance is bliss
It takes two to tango
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Laughter is the best medicine
Make hay while the sun shines
Misery loves company
One man's trash is another man's treasure
Practice makes perfect
The early bird catches the worm
The grass is always greener on the other side
The pen is mightier than the sword
There's no place like home
Two wrongs don't make a right
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When the going gets tough, the tough get going
Where there's a will, there's a way
You can't have your cake and eat it too
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs
You reap what you sow
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush
A chain is only as strong as its weakest link
A fool and his money are soon parted
A leopard can't change its spots
A penny saved is a penny earned
A picture is worth a thousand words
A stitch in time saves nine
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
A breath of fresh air
A drop in the bucket
A fish out of water
A flash in the pan
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step
A rose by any other name would smell as sweet
A watched pot never boils
All that glitters is not gold
Back to the drawing board
Between a rock and a hard place
Born with a silver spoon in one's mouth
Caught between the devil and the deep blue sea
Chew the fat
Close, but no cigar
Dance like nobody's watching
Devil's advocate
Dog days of summer
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't cry over spilt milk
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater
Down to earth
Eat, drink, and be merry
Every dog has its day
Feather in one's cap
Fish or cut bait
Go with the flow
Grasping at straws
Hammer it home
Hit the ground running
In the heat of the moment
Jump on the bandwagon
Let the cat out of the bag
Light at the end of the tunnel
Make a mountain out of a molehill
March to the beat of your own drum
Needle in a haystack
On cloud nine
Once in a blue moon
Pearls of wisdom
Piece of cake
Play it by ear
Pull the wool over someone's eyes
Put the cart before the horse
Raining cats and dogs
Roll with the punches
Shoot for the moon
Skeletons in the closet
Smooth sailing
Spill the beans
Stabbed in the back
Steal someone's thunder
Take the bull by the horns
The calm before the storm
The devil is in the details
The pot calling the kettle black
The whole nine yards
There's more than one way to skin a cat
Throw caution to the wind
To each his own
Too many irons in the fire
Turn over a new leaf
Under the weather
Up the creek without a paddle
Water under the bridge
We'll cross that bridge when we come to it
When pigs fly
You can't make an omelette without breaking eggs
You can't put lipstick on a pig
You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours
A watched clock never boils
Actions speak louder than words
All bark and no bite
All hat and no cattle
Back to square one
Barking up the wrong tree
Beat around the bush
Burn bridges
Can't see the forest for the trees
Cool your jets
Cross that bridge when you come to it
Cry over spilled milk
Cut to the chase
Devil is in the details
Don't count your chickens before they hatch
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Drop like flies
Eat humble pie
Elephant in the room
Fish out of water
Go down in flames
Go out on a limb
Go the extra mile
Hear a pin drop
Keep your chin up
Kick the bucket
Land on your feet
Let the chips fall where they may
Miss the boat
Out of the frying pan, into the fire
Play devil's advocatel
